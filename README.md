# Portfolio Application

The idea here is to host my resume and projects and such



TODOs
Fixes:
- Add in the project cards and start building endpoints for them

Better features
- Add a metrics tracker to track how many views I have gotten and
how many times the view resume thing has been clicked

Next steps for MVP:
- CI pipeline (github actions)
- CD pipeline (github actions / webhook)
- Get it to deploy locally on successful builds
- deploy with gunicorn
- Sign up for cloudflare and get a tunnel working
- Buy a domain and host the site
