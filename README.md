# Portfolio Application

The idea here is to host my resume and projects and such



TODOs
Fixes:
- Make the nav bar colorful
- Add in the project cards and start building endpoints for them


Better features
- Add a Nav button to host other things besides the main home page
- Add a metrics tracker to track how many views I have gotten and
how many times the view resume thing has been clicked
